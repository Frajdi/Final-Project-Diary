Day 1

10:00 - 12:00 Attended the meeting with our mentours , Marco explained to tus how the project should be done and gave us some useful rescorses which will help us in our project .

12:00 - 13:00 We had our lunch break and had some coffee .

13:00 - 14:00 Me and my team did some discusions and planing about how the project should be done and how our workflow should be . We decided thet firstly we need to do the data base tables
since that is the mos important part of the project .

14:00 - 16:00  I halped my team on the crating the tables in the way that Marco`s sent us the sample.

16:00 - 17:00 Some Database testing and overviewing if the database table relations are correct.


Day 2 

9:45 - 10:00 Attended the meeting with Semra our Scrum Master where we discused our workflow of the day before our issues and our fixes.

10:00 - 11:00 We noticed that Marco had done some changes on the database sample so we decided to change it to adapt to our project .

11: 00 - 12:00 Applied the correct changes to our database and we think thet it is finally over with the database.

12:00 - 13:00 We had our lunch break and had some coffee .

13:00 - 15:00 Then me and the teammates did a discussion on how to go forward with the project 

15:00 - 17: 00 We fixed the project structure in order to start working on the fron end part of it with react.


Day 3 

9:45 - 10:00 Attended the meeting with Semra our Scrum Master where we discused our workflow of the day before our issues and our fixes.

10: 00 - 15:00 Created the Question component which i imported from Material UI and did some stilization with it Visi gave e some ideas and a Front-End developer from 
the office helped me with the Material ui component and told me how it works i added to it some porps the prop which will display the question and the prop of answers which
will hold an array of answers which will take place in the radio buttons these props will come from fetching the data that comes from the Reast API which we will crate tomorrow.

15:00 - 16:00 We had our lunch break and had some coffee .

16: 00 - 17: 00 We decided what to do for tomorrow : doing the database fetching and creating the API endpoints .


Day 4
 
9:45 - 10:00 Attended the meeting with Semra our Scrum Master where we discused our workflow of the day before our issues and our fixes.

10:00 12: 00 I did the data fetching from the database using axios library and pulled the data from our API endpoint and did to pull requests from the two tables in our database one 
will bring the data for the question which will go in to the props for the first parameter which is the question and the second endpoint will bring the options which the user has to choose 
so the data from this endpoint will bring the data that will display as radio buttons. 

12:00 - 13:00 We had our lunch break and had some coffee .

14: 00  - 15:00 i finally finished with the work i had left before the lunch break but now i am thinking that it would be better if the data fetching will be done usind React Query so 
the code will be simpler , shorter and easier to read .
